btrbk-0.25.0

  * MIGRATION
    - If you call ssh_filter_btrbk.sh with "--sudo" option, make sure
      to set "backend btrfs-progs-sudo" in btrbk.conf for this host.
    - If "rate_limit" is enabled, update ssh_filter_btrbk.sh on remote
      source hosts, and make sure the "pv" command is available there.

    penalty.

  * INCOMPATIBLE CONFIGURATION:
    * Please read "doc/upgrade_to_v0.23.0.md" for details on updating
      the configuration file (/etc/btrbk/btrbk.conf).
    * Dropped "btrfs_progs_compat" option. Need btrfs-progs >= v3.18.
    * Removed "resume_missing" configuration option.
  * Create backups only if needed to satisfy retention policy.
  * Preserve FIRST backup of hour/day/week/month instead of LAST.
  * Replaced "{snapshot,target}_preserve_{daily,weekly,monthly}"
    configuration options with "{snapshot,target}_preserve_min" and
    "{snapshot,target}_preserve NNh NNd NNw NNm NNy" options.

  * Warn on receive targets at unexpected location (instead of abort).
  * On incremental send/receive, use all snapshots sharing same
    parent_uuid as candidates for "-p <parent>" instead of only older
    snapshots. As last resort, use subvolumes in snapshot_dir matching
    btrbk file name scheme as candidates (which allows incremental
    backups after the parent vanished, e.g. after backup restore).
  * Use perl built-in Time::Local instead of Date::Calc.
  * Improvements of internal data structures.
