btrbk-0.29.0

  * MIGRATION
    - If stream_buffer or rate_limit is configured, please install
      "mbuffer" (version >= 20180505). Note that mbuffer is only
      required on remote hosts if stream_buffer_remote or
      rate_limit_remote is set.
    - In order to mimic old behavior, replace rate_limit with
      rate_limit_remote, and read btrbk.conf(5).
    - If you are using table output other than --format=raw in your
      scripts, note that the column headings changed from pretty
      two-line to (uppercase) one-line format. Either add --pretty
      option to mimic old behavior, or adapt your scripts.
  * Dropped run-time dependency on "pv" (in favor of "mbuffer").
  * Combined stream_buffer and rate_limit: for rate_limit, use
    "mbuffer" (on local host) instead of "pv" (on source host).

    used by "btrbk archive" action (close #297).
  * Bugfix: handle subvolumes with special characters (close #288).
  * Bugfix: don't display "<no_action>" in backup summary if volume is
    skipped by --exclude or noauto (close #291).

  * Bugfix: fix mount point resolving.

btrbk-0.28.2

  * Fix regression: crash if raw target dir is empty (close  #281).

    mountpoint instead of directory.
  * Bugfix: handle directories named "0" correctly.

btrbk-0.28.1

  * Fix regression: crash if deep parent/child relations exceed
    depth=100 (close #279).
  * Remove pre-generated man pages, requires "asciidoctor" for builds.

btrbk-0.28.0

  * MIGRATION
    - Replace "ssh_port" options with "ssh://hostname[:port]" notation
      on "volume" or "target" declarations.
    - Check filter statements in your scripts ("btrbk run <filter>"),
      especially when using groups having the same name as subvolumes.
  * Fix table format "resolved" (btrbk list snapshots|backups).
  * Add btrbk-verify: tool for automated backup integrity check based
    on rsync (close #256).

    "ssh_port" option (now deprecated).

    but distinct port numbers (virtual machines setups, close #233).
  * Remove selected rows ("*host", "*port") from table output if all
    values are empty.
  * Consider all parent/child relations (close #255).
  * Disallow unrelated parents for btrfs-send if incremental=strict.

  * Use more sophisticated filter arguments.
  * Allow whitespace separated "group" option.

btrbk-0.27.2

  * Bump dependency >= btrfs-progs-4.12 (as of btrbk-0.27.0).

  * Bugfix (regression): fix failing "config print" command.
  * Don't print title and blank lines for --format=raw, syslog and
    transaction log.

btrbk-0.27.0

  * MIGRATION
    - Run "btrbk prune --dry-run --print-schedule" and check if any
      snapshots/backups would get deleted [1] [2]. If you want to
      forcibly preserve a snapshot/backup forever, rename it (btrbk
      ignores subvolumes with unknown naming scheme), e.g.:
      "mv mysubvol.YYYYMMDD mysubvol.YYYYMMDD.keep_forever"
    - Update ssh_filter_btrbk.sh on remote hosts (btrbk always calls
      "readlink" and "cat /proc/self/mountinfo").
  * Add "preserve_hour_of_day" configuration option (close #202).
  * Allow backup of filesystem root using "subvolume ." (close #240).
  * Add "-S" command line option (shortcut for --print-schedule).
  * Bugfix: correct scheduling of "first weekly backup in month/year"
    (close #217) [1] [2].
  * Bugfix: add "btrfs filesystem usage" backend mapping (close #222).

    "btrfs snapshot --preserve".
  * Bugfix: if "incremental no" is configured on target, do not keep
    latest common snapshot.
  * Enhance internal data structures:
    - Allow snapshot_dir to be a mountpoint.
    - Search complete target tree for correlated subvolumes.
    - Include snapshots from all mountpoints as candidates (disabled
      due to uptream bug: github.com/kdave/btrfs-progs/issues/96).
    - Read /proc/self/mountinfo instead of /proc/self/mounts.
    - Always read /proc/self/mountinfo.
    - Resolve realpath using readlink(1).
  * Fallback to "asciidoctor" for manpage generation (close #219).

  * Add symmetric encryption for raw targets (close #157).
  * Add "{snapshot,target,archive}_qgroup_destroy" configuration
    options (close #49, #189).
  * Do not run in "perl taint mode" by default: remove "perl -T" in
    hashbang; hardcode $PATH only if taint mode is enabled.
  * Remove "duration" column from transaction_log/transaction_syslog.
  * Resolve ancestors (recursive on parent_uuid chain) when searching
    for latest common subvolume.
  * Generate man pages from asciidoc (remove raw groff sources).

  * Check source subvolumes for readonly and received_uuid flags, and
    abort if one of them is set.

btrbk-0.25.0

  * MIGRATION
    - If you call ssh_filter_btrbk.sh with "--sudo" option, make sure
      to set "backend btrfs-progs-sudo" in btrbk.conf for this host.
    - If "rate_limit" is enabled, update ssh_filter_btrbk.sh on remote
      source hosts, and make sure the "pv" command is available there.
  * Allow converting backup disks to source disks (close #114).
  * Add "backend btrfs-progs-sudo" configuration option (close #115).
  * Show aggregate "size" and "used" for "usage" action (close #119).
  * Add "raw_target_split" configuration option (close #125).
  * Allow trailing comments in btrbk.conf (close #129).
  * Bugfix: rate limiting must be done after compression (close #134).
  * raw_target_encrypt: Always set "gpg --no-random-seed-file":
    prevents creation of "~/.gnupg/random_seed" with slight perfomance
    penalty.

btrbk-0.24.0

  * MIGRATION
    - update ssh_filter_btrbk.sh on remote hosts if "stream_compress"
      is enabled. Also add "--compress" option to ssh_filter_btrbk.sh
      invocation if "stream_compress" is enabled.
  * Add "stream_compress" configuration option.
  * Perform extra metadata check on target subvolume after "btrfs
    receive" (adds an additional call to "btrfs subvolume show").

    (close: #85).
  * Add syslog output of transaction log (close #82).

btrbk-0.23.0

  * INCOMPATIBLE CONFIGURATION:
    * Please read "doc/upgrade_to_v0.23.0.md" for details on updating
      the configuration file (/etc/btrbk/btrbk.conf).

  * Detect interrupted transfers of raw targets (close: #75).
  * Always read "readonly" flag (additional call to btrfs-progs).
  * Warn on receive targets at unexpected location (instead of abort).
  * On incremental send/receive, use all snapshots sharing same
    parent_uuid as candidates for "-p <parent>" instead of only older
    snapshots. As last resort, use subvolumes in snapshot_dir matching
    btrbk file name scheme as candidates (which allows incremental
    backups after the parent vanished, e.g. after backup restore).
  * Use perl built-in Time::Local instead of Date::Calc.
  * Improvements of internal data structures.

    compatibility with all linux distros out there, which all install
    'btrfs' in different locations (close: #20).

  * Include systemd service and timer unit for daily backups.
