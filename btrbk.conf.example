# Example btrbk configuration file

# Note that the options can be overridden per volume/subvolume/target

# Enable transaction log
transaction_log            /var/log/btrbk.log

# Enable stream buffer. Adding a buffer between the sending and
# receiving side is generally a good idea.
# NOTE: If enabled, make sure the "mbuffer" package is installed on
# the target host!
stream_buffer              512m

# Directory in which the btrfs snapshots are created. Relative to
# <volume-directory> of the volume section.
# If not set, the snapshots are created in <volume-directory>.
#
# If you want to set a custom name for the snapshot (and backups),
# use the "snapshot_name" option within the subvolume section.
#
# NOTE: btrbk does not autmatically create this directory, and the
# snapshot creation will fail if it is not present.
#
snapshot_dir               _btrbk_snap

# Always create snapshots. Set this to "ondemand" to only create
# snapshots if the target volume is reachable. Set this to "no" if
# snapshot creation is done by another instance of btrbk.

# Perform incremental backups (set to "strict" if you want to prevent
# creation of non-incremental backups if no parent is found).

# Specify after what time (in full hours after midnight) backups/
# snapshots are considered as a daily backup/snapshot

#stream_compress_level      default
#stream_compress_threads    default

# Enable lock file support: Ensures that only one instance of btrbk
# can be run at a time.
#lockfile                   /var/lock/btrbk.lock

# Don't wait for transaction commit on deletion. Set this to "after"

#
# Volume section: "volume <volume-directory>"
#
#   <volume-directory>  Directory of a btrfs volume (or subvolume)
#                       containing the subvolume to be backuped
#                       (usually the mount-point of a btrfs filesystem
#                       mounted with subvolid=5 option)
#
# Subvolume section: "subvolume <subvolume-name>
#
#   <subvolume-name>    Subvolume to be backuped, relative to
#                       <volume-directory> in volume section.
#
# Target section: "target <type> <volume-directory>"
#
#   <type>              Backup type, currently only "send-receive".
#   <volume-directory>  Directory of a btrfs volume (or subvolume)
#                       receiving the backups.
#
# NOTE: The parser does not care about indentation, this is only for
# human readability. The options always apply to the last section
# encountered, overriding the corresponding option of the upper
# section. This means that the global options must be set before any
# "volume" section.
