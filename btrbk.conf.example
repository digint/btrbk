# Directory in which the btrfs snapshots are created. Relative to

# If not set, the snapshots are created in <volume-directory>.
#
# If you want to set a custom name for the snapshot (and backups),

#
# NOTE: btrbk does not automatically create this directory, and the
# snapshot creation will fail if it is not present.

#
# Volume section (optional): "volume <volume-directory>"
#
#   <volume-directory>  Base path within a btrfs filesystem
#                       containing the subvolumes to be backuped
#                       (usually the mount-point of a btrfs filesystem
#                       mounted with subvolid=5 option).
#
# Subvolume section: "subvolume <subvolume-name>"
#
#   <subvolume-name>    Subvolume to be backuped, relative to
#                       <volume-directory> in volume section.
#
# Target section: "target <type> <volume-directory>"
#
#   <type>              (optional) type, defaults to "send-receive".
#   <volume-directory>  Directory within a btrfs filesystem
#                       receiving the backups.
#
# NOTE: The parser does not care about indentation, this is only for
# human readability. All options apply to the last section
# encountered, overriding the corresponding option of the upper
# section. This means that the global options must be set on top,
# before any "volume", "subvolume" or "target section.

# Simple setup: Backup root and home to external disk
#
snapshot_dir /btrbk_snapshots
target       /mnt/btr_backup
subvolume    /
subvolume    /home


#
# Complex setup
#
# In order to keep things organized, it is recommended to use "volume"
# sections and mount the top-level subvolume (subvolid=5):
#
#  $ mount -o subvolid=5 /dev/sda1 /mnt/btr_pool
#
# Backup to external disk mounted on /mnt/btr_backup
volume /mnt/btr_pool
  # Create snapshots in /mnt/btr_pool/btrbk_snapshots
  snapshot_dir btrbk_snapshots

  # Target for all subvolume sections:
  target /mnt/btr_backup

  # Some default btrfs installations (e.g. Ubuntu) use "@" for rootfs
  # (mounted at "/") and "@home" (mounted at "/home"). Note that this
  # is only a naming convention.
  #subvolume @
  subvolume root
  subvolume home
  subvolume kvm
    # Use different retention policy for kvm backups:
    target_preserve 7d 4w


# Backup data to external disk as well as remote host
volume /mnt/btr_data
  subvolume  data
    # Always create snapshot, even if targets are unreachable
    snapshot_create always
    target /mnt/btr_backup
    target ssh://backup.my-remote-host.com/mnt/btr_backup


# Backup from remote host, with different naming
volume ssh://my-remote-host.com/mnt/btr_pool
  subvolume data_0
    snapshot_dir   snapshots/btrbk
    snapshot_name  data_main
    target /mnt/btr_backup/my-remote-host.com
